# Nyc-Taxi-Trip-Duration
This project focuses on predicting the duration of individual taxi trips in New York City using the 2016 Yellow Cab trip record data. The dataset was originally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) and later sampled and cleaned for a Kaggle playground competition.
